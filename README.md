##WAVI Web Application Viewer (Node.js)

Generate a class diagram graph for node.js web application inspired by the Web Application Extension (WAE) for UML.

WAVI is intended for developers who wish to document their web application or as a reverse engineering tool to recover 
the structure of a web application.

Web applications pose unique challenges when it comes to understanding and maintaining their heterogeneous structures, which often involve complex interactions between elements from different languages. Accurate and up-to-date documentation is rarely available and this calls for the proposal of reverse engineering approaches for the recovery and representation of such structures. The proposed package presents our ongoing work on Web Application Viewer (WAVE), a tool able to reverse engineer a web application's structure.


## Dependencies
```
Require Graphviz installed and PATH variable for Graphviz in your environment variable.

## Installation

    $ npm install wavi -g

```

##Usage (CLI): 

It is strongly advised to use svg format for very large website because jpg/png/pdf are limited in width and height and will most likly not work
or use ratio and the quality will be bad.

wavi --format path/to/website path/to/result/file

Example:
```
wavi --svg website/example result/example.svg

wavi --jpg website/example result/example.jpg

wavi --png website/example result/example.png

wavi --pdf website/example result/example.pdf

wavi --dot website/example result/example.dot

wavi --svg website/example result/example.svg --includenodemodules

```

In Ubuntu:
make sure you add /usr/local/bin to your PATH or use absolute path to wavi.

Example:
```
nodejs /usr/local/bin/wavi --svg ./path/to/website ./graph.png

```

##Usage: 

wavi.generateGraph("format","website/example","result/file.type",includenodemodules ...

```
var wavi = require("wavi");

wavi.generateGraph("svg","website/example","result/example2.svg",false,function(err){

});
```

##Parameter

--includenodemodules : include node_modules folder, use this parameter to include relations of "node_modules" folder.


##Example:

![Example](/example/result/example.png?raw=true "Example")

run example/example.cmd in node console or node example

Here are the result of wavi on a couple of framework.

##TROUBLESHOOTING



-If your web application is too large and your image is empty or the quality of the image is bad, this means that there is
not sufficent space to draw the diagram. Try using "svg" format.

-Do not run wavi in the root of your web application like:

wavi --pdf . result/example.pdf

This does not work yet. Instead run wavi from a parent folder like in the example.


##Contributions

This is a big project to help developers generate quality class diagram. WAVI is in early development and all contributions are welcomed.
